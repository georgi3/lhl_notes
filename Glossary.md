### Glossary
* Three types of errors:
  * Optimization - 
  * Estimation - 
  * Approximation - 

* Supervised VS Unsupervised 
  * In supervised we need to know the labels of the columns
  * In unsupervised we don't need to know the name of the columns
  
* Gaussian Distribution
  * Could be plotted
  * mean == median == mode
  * Shapiro-Wilk test

* PDF - probability density function
* Bias Variance Trade off
* Three Ensemble Techniques
  * Bagging
  * Boosting 
  * Stacking
