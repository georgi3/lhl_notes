 The Chinook Database is about an imaginary video and music store.
  Each track is stored using one of the digital formats and has a genre. 
  The store has also some playlists, where a single track can be part of
   several playlists. Orders are recorded for customers, but are called 
   invoices. Every customer is assigned a support employee, and Employees 
   report to other employees.
