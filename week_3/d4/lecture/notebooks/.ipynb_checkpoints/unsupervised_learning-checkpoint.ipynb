    "1. ML is a technique where a certain computer program accepts inputs and predicts a target variable. \n",
    "2. The way this is achieved is by training the algorithm on a sample of dataset\n",
    "3. There is cost/penalty function which is monitored as it is moving through the data points.\n",
    "4. The algorithm tries to reduce the cost/penalty function as much as possible.\n",
    "5. By doing so the algorithm gets closer to predicting correct values\n",
